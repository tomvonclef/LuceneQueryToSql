# LuceneQueryToSql

Version 0.1.0

This is a library that translates Lucene.NET QueryParser syntax to SQL.
It uses Lucene.NET v3.0.3 to do the actual parsing of text into Query objects.

It was developed to support SQL Server, but could be easily extended to support
other databases.

LuceneQueryToSql is under development in Visual Studio 2015.

This library was inspired by the blog post:
